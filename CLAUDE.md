# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fleeterzen is a multi-tenant SaaS fleet management platform. Companies manage drivers, vehicles, and job assignments. Drivers use a mobile-optimised interface to update job status, record odometer readings, and navigate to job locations via Google Maps. A vendor portal (super-admin layer) allows the software owner to manage customer companies, plans, and billing.

## Project Location

The working copy is at `C:\LogiTrack` (moved off OneDrive to avoid sync conflicts).
Git remote: `https://github.com/Miksan100/logistics-routing-app.git`

## Development Commands

### Backend
```bash
cd C:\LogiTrack\backend
# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in DB credentials and JWT_SECRET + VENDOR_JWT_SECRET
node src/app.js        # start (no nodemon — use node directly on this machine)
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd C:\LogiTrack\frontend
npm run dev            # Next.js dev server (run from Windows PowerShell, not Git Bash)
npm run build && npm start
npm run lint
```

### Database
PostgreSQL on localhost:5432, database `logistics_db` (local), user `postgres`.
Run migrations manually via psql or `node migrations/run.js` (requires node in PATH).
Migration 002 adds `vendor_users`, `plans`, and extends `companies` with billing columns.
Seed: `admin@demo.com` / `Admin1234!`

### UAT Testing (ngrok)
Run `.\start-uat.ps1` from an Administrator PowerShell window at `C:\LogiTrack`.
- Kills any running node/ngrok processes
- Starts backend, then ngrok (single tunnel on port 3000 — free tier)
- Patches `frontend/.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/proxy-api` and `BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000` (read-and-patch, never overwrites secrets)
- Updates `backend/.env` CORS_ORIGIN to include the ngrok URL
- Restarts backend with updated CORS, then starts frontend
- Prints the shareable ngrok URL when ready

The proxy route at `app/proxy-api/[...path]/route.ts` forwards all API calls from the ngrok domain to `localhost:4000`, solving the ngrok free-tier single-tunnel limitation.

`ngrok.yml` at `C:\LogiTrack\ngrok.yml` defines the single `frontend` tunnel on port 3000. ngrok authtoken lives in the default config (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ngrok\ngrok.yml`).

### Windows-specific notes
- Run `npm run dev` from **Windows PowerShell**, not Git Bash — Git Bash cannot find `node` for npm scripts.
- Use `/c/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe` for direct node calls from Git Bash.
- The Write tool fails with EEXIST. Use Node.js file patching: `node -e "const fs=require('fs'); let c=fs.readFileSync(path,'utf8'); ..."`

## Architecture Decisions

### Multi-tenancy
Every table (except `companies` and `vendor_users`) has a `company_id` column. All service functions include `WHERE company_id = $n`. Never query without it.

### Auth Flow — Tenant (company users)
1. `POST /api/auth/login` returns JWT `{ userId, companyId, role }`.
2. Frontend stores token in **sessionStorage** (per-tab isolation).
3. Axios interceptor injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request.
4. Backend `middleware/auth.js` verifies JWT with `JWT_SECRET`, re-fetches user row **joining companies** to check `company.is_active`. Suspended company → 403.
5. `requireRole('admin')` or `requireRole('driver')` guards protect routes.

### Auth Flow — Vendor Portal
1. `POST /api/vendor/auth/login` returns JWT `{ vendorUserId, role: 'vendor' }` signed with `VENDOR_JWT_SECRET`.
2. Frontend stores token under key `fl_vendor_token` in sessionStorage.
3. All `/api/vendor/*` routes use `middleware/vendorAuth.js` — completely isolated from tenant auth.
4. Vendor JWT is rejected by all tenant routes (wrong secret + no userId claim).

### Route → Service Pattern
Routes in `src/routes/` are thin: validate inputs, call service, return JSON. All SQL lives in `src/services/`.

### Driver / User Account Relationship
Creating a driver automatically creates a linked `users` row (role = `driver`). Driver email/name updates sync to `users`. Drivers log in via their user account. `plain_password` column stores plaintext password for admin visibility.

### Job Status Machine
```
pending → started → in_progress → completed
               ↘                ↘
                cancelled ←──────
```
Cancellation requires a non-empty reason. Every transition logged to `job_status_updates`.

### Odometer Flow
When driver starts a job: prompted for start odometer → calls `POST /api/odometer/start-day`.
When driver completes a job: prompted for end odometer → calls `POST /api/odometer/end-day`.
Both endpoints accept optional `vehicleId` in the body as fallback if driver has no permanently assigned vehicle (uses the job's `assigned_vehicle_id`).

### GPS Route Tracking
On job start: driver taps "Open in Google Maps". The URL uses the pickup address as a **waypoint** and delivery as the destination, with no origin set — Maps uses the driver's current GPS location automatically. This gives the correct: current location → pickup → delivery route.
Browser `watchPosition` records GPS points and POSTs to `POST /api/tracking/job/:jobId/track`.
Points stored in `job_gps_tracks` table. Admin views routes in Job History via Leaflet/OpenStreetMap (free).
Google Maps API key stored in `frontend/.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY` and `backend/.env` as `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (also in Vercel/Railway env vars for production).
**Important:** API key is currently unrestricted — must be locked to production domain in Google Cloud Console before go-live.
`lib/googleMaps.ts` — `buildGoogleMapsUrl` constructs the Maps deep-link URL. `getRouteData` fetches polyline/distance/duration via the Directions API.

### Dashboard Stats Split
`getDashboardStats` returns two sets: all-time job counts + today-only counts.
"Overall Completion Rate for Today" uses `completed_today / total_today`.

### Job Copy
Admin can copy any job (Copy icon on job cards). Pre-fills the create modal with source job data, resets scheduled date to today, prefixes title with "Copy of …".

### Vendor Portal — Company Lifecycle
Vendor creates company → transaction: insert companies row + admin users row → returns credentials.
Vendor suspends company (sets `is_active = false`) → all company sessions get 403 on next API call.
Plans stored in `plans` table. `companies.plan_status` ∈ `{trial, active, suspended, cancelled}`.

## API Reference

- Backend base: `http://localhost:4000/api`
- Health check: `GET /health`
- GPS ingestion (no auth): `POST /api/tracking/gps`
- Job GPS track (driver): `POST /api/tracking/job/:jobId/track`
- Job route (admin): `GET /api/tracking/job/:jobId/route`
- Job history list (admin): `GET /api/tracking/jobs`
- Weather proxy (tenant or vendor JWT): `GET /api/weather?lat=X&lng=Y`
- Vendor auth: `POST /api/vendor/auth/login`, `GET /api/vendor/auth/me`
- Vendor companies: `GET/POST /api/vendor/companies`, `GET /api/vendor/companies/:id`
- Vendor company actions: `PATCH /api/vendor/companies/:id/status|plan|notes|billing`
- Vendor admin status: `PATCH /api/vendor/companies/:id/admins/:userId/status`
- Vendor impersonate: `POST /api/vendor/companies/:id/impersonate` (body: `{ userId? }`)
- Vendor stats: `GET /api/vendor/stats`
- Vendor plans: `GET /api/vendor/plans`

All tenant endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <tenant-jwt>`.
All vendor endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <vendor-jwt>`.

## Database Tables
Standard: `companies`, `users`, `drivers`, `vehicles`, `jobs`, `job_status_updates`, `odometer_logs`, `gps_tracking`
Added: `job_gps_tracks` (id, company_id, job_id, driver_id, latitude, longitude, accuracy, timestamp)
Migration 002: `vendor_users`, `plans`; extended `companies` with plan_id, plan_status, trial_ends_at, billing_email, payment_gateway_customer_id, payment_gateway_sub_id, notes

## Frontend Dependencies
Includes `leaflet@1.9.4` and `react-leaflet@4.2.1` (v4 required for React 18 — v5 requires React 19).
RouteMap component must be loaded with `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`.

## Production Deployment (Railway + Vercel)
`backend/src/config/database.js` accepts `DATABASE_URL` env var (Railway postgres).
When `DATABASE_URL` is set, SSL is enabled with `rejectUnauthorized: false`.
Run both migrations (001 + 002) on the production database before first deploy.

## Secret / Credential Safety — MANDATORY

**Never hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or any secrets in any file that is committed to git.**

Rules:
- Secrets live ONLY in `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` — all gitignored.
- Scripts (e.g. `start-uat.ps1`), config files, and source code that are committed must NEVER contain literal secret values.
- If a script needs to write to an env file, it must READ the existing file and PATCH only the specific lines it needs — never rewrite the whole file with secrets embedded.
- Before staging any file for commit, verify it contains no secrets. If it does, move the value to an env file and reference via environment variable.
- If a secret is accidentally committed: rotate it immediately in the relevant service (Google Cloud, Railway, etc.), fix the code, and push. Inform the user so they can rotate their credentials.

Env files in this project and where secrets live:
- `backend/.env` — DB credentials, JWT secrets, Google Maps API key, SMTP credentials
- `frontend/.env.local` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `BACKEND_URL`
- Neither file is ever committed (both covered by root `.gitignore`)

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
Must complete before going live:
- [ ] Restrict Google Maps API key to production domains (currently unrestricted)
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY` in Vercel env vars
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.fleeterzen.com/api` in Vercel
- [ ] Set strong `JWT_SECRET` and `VENDOR_JWT_SECRET` in Railway (not dev values)
- [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to exact production domain in Railway
- [ ] Set `DATABASE_URL` in Railway
- [ ] Run migrations 001 + 002 on Railway Postgres
- [ ] DNS: fleeterzen.com registered, api.fleeterzen.com → Railway, app.fleeterzen.com → Vercel
- [ ] Confirm plain_password column removed before any real clients onboarded
